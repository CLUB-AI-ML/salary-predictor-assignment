Execution Plan (Step-by-Step)
This roadmap guides you from setup all the way to passing the automated judging tests.
Phase 1: Setup & Data Preparation
Repository: Create a new GitHub repository named salary-predictor.
Environment: Set up a local Python environment (using virtualenv or Conda).
Data: Create a file named salary_data.csv inside a dataset/ folder and paste the provided 100-row dataset into it.
Phase 2: Exploration & Analysis
Load: Import pandas and read the CSV file.
Visualize: Create a scatter plot (Experience on X-axis vs. Salary on Y-axis) to visually confirm that the data forms a roughly straight line (linear relationship).
Phase 3: Building the Model
Split: Divide the data into a Training Set (80%) and a Test Set (20%) using train_test_split.
Train: Import LinearRegression from Scikit-Learn and fit the model on the Training Set only.
Phase 4: Internal Evaluation (The "Self-Check")
Predict: Use the model to predict salaries for the Test Set.
Calculate Metrics: instead of "Accuracy," calculate:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Must be below 7000.
R^2 Score: Must be 0.90 or higher.
Visualize Results: Plot the "Best Fit Line" over the data points to see how well the model learned.
Phase 5: Validation & Submission (Crucial Step)
Run the Judging Block: Add the specific "Validation Code" provided at the end of the notebook.
Generate Proof: Ensure the code successfully passes the thresholds and generates the submission/ folder containing:
model_performance.txt (The score report).
actual_vs_pred.png (The visual proof plot).
Push to GitHub: Commit all files (including the submission/ folder) and push them to the repository for review.
